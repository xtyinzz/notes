  - ## 17.1 Bassic
    - Differential Equation:
      - An equation have as unknowns functions involving their derivatie. For example:
      $$\frac{dy}{dx}=3y$$
    - Linearity
      - *Homogenous Linear* if given solutions $f_1, f_2$ and numbers $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$
        - $f_1\lambda_1 + f_2\lambda_2$ is another solution
      - *Linear* if subtracting off a function of independent variable makes the DE *homogenous linear*. For example:
        - $\frac{\partial^2y}{\partial x^2}-\frac{\partial^2y}{\partial t^2}=x$, subtracting x
