### Distributed and Parallel Algorithms

- [x] **Asynchronous and Load-Balanced Union-Find for Distributed and Parallel Scientific Data Visualization and Analysis [TVCG, 2021]**, J. Xu et al.  [[Paper]](pdfs/Asynchronous-Load-Balanced-Union-Find.pdf)
  > Global synchronization and imbalanced workload, as two bottlenecks of distrubuted and parallel Union-Find algorithm used for critical point tracking and super-level set extraction, are proposed to be improved by asynchronous communication and data redistribution.
  - Asynchronous communication:
    - Changes from global sync:
      - ~~Unit by rank/size~~: unit by ID (local, no comm)
      - edge passing -> made async
      - grandparents query -> made async
    - convergence
      - boundary case handled (e.g. local root with set root parent will be prevented querying grandparents until a change in set root), no cycles (unit by ID), at least one edge consumed/iteration -> converge/terminate in finite iteration with disjoint set tree of rank 2
    - correctness
      - edge union order doesn't matter (ID is unique globally) -> two elements in a connected component always belongs to the same disjoint set, convergence with ran 2 -> ideal disjoint set guaranteed with smallest ID element as set root
  - k-d split data Redistribution:
    1. start with all processes in one group and the complete data domain
    2. find dim's median coordinate
    3. split processes in even/odd groups
    4. exchange data between splitted processes s.t. even got data below median and odd got others
    ![k-d-split illustration](imgs/asyncunionfind-k-d-split.png)
  <br>

  > Takeaways:
  > - distributed algorihtm accelerated by overlapping comm with computation (async)
  >   - async algorithm's result correctness: same as sync or other correct outcomes
  >   - load balancing
  > - k-d tree: effectively balance spatial data partition

  > Data reduction by fitting GMM (# components estimated from trials) to the k-d partitioned large-scale particle domain. leaf GMM refined until hitting a desired # of leaves. Data reconstructed post-hoc Monte Carlo.
  - two-stage spliting (1. coarse stage: [0,1]*F GMM/leaf; 2. refinement stage: F leaves)
    - 1st stage: for particle load balance
      - F # of tree nodes, T $\in$ [0, 1]  -> T*F subspaces total
      - Select leaf with most particles to partition. Partition along highest *variance* dimension on *mean* value.
    - 2nd stage: refine for distribution quality
      - spliting leaves until hitting F total # of leaves
      - split the leave with lowest *score*
        - $p_\theta(x)=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{K}\omega_i*N(\mu_i,\sigma_i)$ -> sum of probability $x$ coming from each component
        - $L(\theta|x1,...,x_n)=\prod\limits_{j=1}^{n}p_\theta(x_j)$: likelyhood of observation coming from this GMM
        - $Score:L/N$ normalized likelihood
    - Importance of T:
      - More leaves in 1st stage (larger T) -> less quality & better runtime. Vice versa.
  - Selection of # of components:
    - $AIC=2k-2ln(L(\theta|x))$ (Akaike Information Criterion)
    - $eAIC = 2k*n-\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}2ln(L(\theta|x))$
    - fit GMM with different # of components on dataset and select the one with lowest eAIC
  - Reconstruct particle with GMM + MC sampling
  - Evaluation: 
    - physics criterion (power spectrum & halo mass function) error low, meeting domain expert's demand.
    - visualization error low
  - Future Work: visualize GMM directly non-MC (computation efficiency)

  > A mutivariate distribution framework avoiding exponential storage cost using the Copula function
  - Copula Function/Copula:
    - multivariate CDF whose univariate margianls are uniform distribution
    - Sklar's Theorem: every joint CDF in $R^d$ implicitly consists of a d-dimensional copula function
    $$
    \begin{align}
    \begin{split} \tag{1}
    F(x_1, x_2...x_d) & = C(F_1(x_1), F_2(x_2)...F_d(x_d)) \\
                      & = C(u_1, u_2...u_d) \quad (using F_i(x_i) = u_i \sim U[0,1])
    \end{split}
    \end{align}
    $$
    $$
    \begin{align}
    \begin{split} \tag{2}
    f(x_1, x_2...x_d) & = (F_1(x_1), F_2(x_2)...F_d(x_d)) \prod_{i=1}^d f_i(x_i)\\
                      & = c(u_1, u_2...u_d) \\
                      & = \frac{\partial C(u_1...u_d)}{\partial u_1...\partial u_d}
    \end{split}
    \end{align}
    $$
      - Implication from formula, need:
        - a) univariate CDFs $F_i$
        - b) corresponding Copula $C(u_1...u_i)$
          - use Gaussian copula, derived from standard multivariate normal
            - *good for data reduction for only storing correlation matrix (?)*
      - *Gaussian Copula*
        - s
    - 2-stage
      - Univariate Distribution Estimation
      - Dependency Modelling

  > Takeaways
  > - univariate marignal CDF: marginalize all other variables and keep only one variable to compute CDF

- [x] **Statistical Super Resolution for Data Analysis and Visualization of Large Scale Cosmological Simulations [Pvis, 2019]**, K. -C. Wang, J. Xu, J. Woodring and H. -W. Shen [[Paper]](pdfs/Statistical_Super_Resolution_for_Data_Analysis_and_Visualization_of_Large_Scale_Cosmological_Simulations.pdf)
  > Data Reduction by summarizing blocks of regular grid volume as GMM, and reconstruct the high-res volume with GMM sampling + location dictionary feature vector matching (computed from *prior simulations*)
  - Mapping GMM samples to high-res locations
    - feature vector $f_h$ of block *h* composed of stat moments of $\mu,\sigma$ of self and neighbour blocks
    - spatial info look-up table: $f_h$ -> $s_i$ mapping feature of block *h* to location *i*
    - in *prior* runs, calculate the *Cross Reconstruction Error* (CE):
      - data block $h_i, h_j$; data samples $U_{h_i}, U_{h_j}$; location info $s_{h_i}, s_{h_j}$
      - $recon(h_i, h_j)=recontructed\ h_i\ with\ U_{h_i}\ with\ s_{h_j}$
      - $CE(h_i,h_j)=\frac{NormRMSE(h_i, recon(h_i, h_j)) + NormRMSE(h_j, recon(h_j, h_i))}{2}$
    - Then, optimize a distance metric in feature space (with $f_h$) to approximate CE
      - minimize $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{N}\sum\limits_{j=i}^{N}(D(f_{h_i}, f_{h_j}) - CE(h_i, h_j))^2$

    - **Question: How come this is super-res? The down-sampled data is in a form of distribution, not the actual low-res data**
  <br>
  > Takeaways:
  > - In data reduction with GMM, sample location consideration is non-trivial, and there seems to be room for improvement or reduction/super-res methods that work with location information directly.

  > Modelled ensemble scalar fields as nonparametric pdf random field (e.g. histogram) with analytical interpolation by box-spline convolution. Integrating pdfs over TF further propagates uncertainty to the DVR pipeline

  - Goal: propagate uncertainty thruout entire DVR pipeline with nonparametric model(with analytical solution)
    - Q1: what's the probability distribution of the random field at an arbitrary point along a viewing ray? (pdf interpolation)
    - Q2: how to analytically incorporate the probability distribution in the volume rendering intergral? (uncertain-aware TF classification)
  - Uncertainty modelling
    - ensemble scalar fields as random variable field with non-parametric pdfs
  - Box-Splines for Non-Parametric PDF Interpolation
    - interpolated random variable X as convolution
      - $pdf_X(x)=pdf_{w_1X_1}(x)*pdf_{w_2X_2}(x)*...*pdf_{w_KX_K}(x)$ 
        - where $pdf_{w_iX_i}=\frac{1}{w_i}pdf_{X_i}(x/w_i)$
      - (NOT UNDERSTANDING) BOX SPLINE SPACE IS CLOSED UNDER CONVOLUTION:
        - implication: conv of box-splines can be represented with anther box-spline, containing all weights as directions
        - $pdf_X(x)=M_{[w_1,w_2,...,w_K]}(x)$
          - when all $w_i=1$, box-spline is univariate B-spline with equally spaced knots. (so what? significance?)
  - Probabilistic Transfer Function Classification
    - For a random varialbe at arbitrary postion, integrate its pdf with TF.
      - Ex. Opacity: $E(\alpha)=\int\alpha(t)pdf_X(t)dt$
  - Results:
    - real-time rendering (>30 fps)
    - reveals fine features with transfer function highlighting feature isovalues, comparing to fuzzy isosurfacing, LCP field DVR, and gaussian process regression (?)

  > Explore ensemble data as nonparametric representations of (a): empirical distributions, (b): histograms, (c): KDE, instead of the previously explored Gaussian field
  > NOTE: one KDE for entir dataset; NOT on vertices
  > For KDE, methods proposed to 1) compute valid consistent marginal distributions, 2) get correlations with principal component transformation, 3) automatic bandwidth selection
  - **Nonparametric Models**
    - **Empirical Distribution (confused)**:
      - $f(y)=\sum_{i=1}^L\phi _i\delta (y-v_i)$
      - sum of $v_i=y$ weighted by $\phi_i$
      - How is this a probability
    - Historgram
    - Kernel Density Estimate
      - $f(y,H)=\sum_{i=1}^L\phi _i\kappa(y;v_i,H)$
      - flavors of bandwidith matrix H:
        - gaussian kernel: $H \lrArr \Sigma$
        - 1.) scaled identity $H=h^2I$. constant variance
        - 2.) diagonal $H=diag(h_1^2, h_2^2, ... , h_{\chi M}^2)$. individual bandwidth, no correlation
        - 3.) symmetric positive definite matrices, representing bandwidth with linear dependencies
      - bandwidth selection
        - 1.) Mean Integrated Squared Error
          - MISE(H) = $E(\int(f(x,H)-f^*(x))^2dx)$
            - approx: asymptotic MISE
        - 2.) Silverman's rule of thumb
          - $h_i=(\frac{4}{d+2})^{\frac{1}{(d+4)}}L^\frac{-1}{d+4}\sigma_i$
          - L: # of data points
    - **Marginalization**
      - For local feature probability (e.g. LCP) outside-cell points should be marginalized
      - $K_c$: # of points (i.e. dof) for cell c
      - $\chi$: # of variables per point (i.e. state space dimension)
      - Empirical Distribution
        - discard spare dimensions
      - Histogram
        - compute joint hist of local/cell points
      - KDE
        - Gaussian kernel: $H_c$ drops spare dimensions
    - **Principal Components Transformation**
      - symmetric positive definite $H$ hard to estimate in high dim
      - PCA applied to 0-mean realizations and then KDE
      - $A=[(v_{1,c}-\mu), (v_{1,c}-\mu), ..., (v_{L,c}-\mu)]$
      - $B=KLT(A)=[m(v_{1,c}-\mu), m(v_{1,c}-\mu), ..., m(v_{L,c}-\mu)]$
        - m is transformation matrix (i.e. eigenvectors in PCA(?))
    - **Feature Probability**
      - $P(c)=\int_Df_c(y_c)dy_c=\int_{\real^{\chi K_c}}f_c(y_c)I(c, y_c)d_yc=E(I(c,\cdot))$
      - $f_c$: pdf of cell
      - $I(c,y)$: feature indicator function in cell c with components y

  > Takeaways:
  > - Usage of Uncertainty in Scivis: represent data as distribution fields. Research opportunities arise in
  >   - different types of distributions (e.g. param/nonparam)

- **Review: EM algorithm**
  - Problem:
    - Assumethere is an unknown statistical model with some parameters $\theta$, from which some observations $X=(x_1,...,x_n)$ are generated. Want to find the model by maximizing the likehood of the parameter given observations $P(\theta;X) = \prod_iP(\theta;x_i)$    - 
      - max this is equivalent to max the log form, which is by setting the derivative to 0:
      - $logP(\theta;X) = \sum_ilogP(\theta;x_i)$
        - **Now: No analytical solution. How to maximize?**
          - introduce hidden indicator variable $Z$ mapping $x_i$ to its membered component. Then can, for each member, get MLE of parameters
          - $Z$ unknown, and EM goes in and estimate E, then use E to update param, then estimate E again, then ...... until convergence
  - Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for GMM
    - GMM pdf: $p(x)=\sum_i^k\alpha_iN(x;\mu_i,\sigma_i)$
    - Expectation: approximate $Z$ (i.e. $\alpha$s) with observation and current parameters:
      - $P(\alpha_i|x_j)=\alpha_{norm}P(x_j|\alpha_i)P(\alpha_i)$
        - $P(x_j|\alpha_i)$ is $N(\mu_i,\sigma_i)$ in GMM optimization
        - under perfect indicator assumption $P(\alpha_i|x_j)$ should be 1, but we can only approximate
    - Maximization (MLE with $P(x_j|\alpha_i)$):
      - Define $N_i=\sum_jP(\alpha_i|x_j)$
        - intuitively for an indicator function Z (which we can only appximate), it's the number of observations in this component
      - $\mu_i=\frac{1}{N_i}\sum_jx_jP(\alpha_i|x_j)$
      - $\sigma_i^2=\frac{1}{N_i}\sum_j(x_j-\mu_i)^2P(\alpha_i|x_j)$
      - $\alpha_i=\frac{N_i}{\sum_jN_j}$
    - Goes back to Expectation and update our approximated $Z$ and then update parameters with new Z, iteratively.

- [ ] **Mixture Density Network [Classics, 1994]** Christopher M. Bishop [[Paper]](pdfs/NCRG_94_004.pdf)
  - Question:
    - Difference between EM on GMM?
      - MDN provides conditional pdf: $P(y|x)=\sum_if_\alpha(x) N(f_\mu(x),f_\sigma(x))$
    - softmax and exponential term theoretical interpretation
      - softmax for component prior: sum to one
      - sigma = exp(z): un-informative Bayesian prior, assuming z has uniform distribution; avoid variance goes to 0

- **Question: GMM vs KDE?**
  - is GMM a simplified KDE with fewer components?
  - No:
    - KDE: each data point represent a distribution
    - GMM: data points conform to a predefined mixture of components
