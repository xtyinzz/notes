- [ ] **Uncertainty-Aware Radiance Fields AND Controllable Rendered Image**
  - Uncertain Randiance Field:
    - learn a ray/sample to distribution function
      - fixing camera, varying image of different ensemble runs
      - 
  - Uncertain Visualization
    - animated rendering with SAME parameter (showing uncertainty)
  - Parameter Exploration
    - animated rendering with DIFF parameter (showing paremter sensitivity)

  - main idea and questions:
    - how is MT diffirentiable and more "performant" than MC
